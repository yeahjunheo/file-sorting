# file-sorting-and-unsorting

This a python-project to devise a program that can sort and unsort the files in a folder, mainly my downloads folder. Additionally, it is also to understand the logic behind and learn new modules available in Python.

The file-sorting program is based on an article by Automation Feed, who gives a thorough explanation on the logic behind a file-sorting program. However, it also contained some misses in logic, which created unnecessary folders within the downloads folder. Therefore, I also adjusted some areas and devise another program that would reverse the operations of the file-sorting program called unsorting_downloads. 

At the moment, both programs are quite long with 40+ lines; however, this is only temporary and I am finding other methods to find a more general approach to this task.
