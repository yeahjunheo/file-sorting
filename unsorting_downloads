The logic behind this code is get all files in the download's folder.
Then find all the folders and make a list of it.
Go in the folder and make a list of items in that folder.
If null, delete folder; if not null, move all items to downloads folder then delete the folder.

Note that this program is an unsorting specifically targetted at unsorting the folders made by the sorting program. 
Pretty sure there are quicker and shorter programs available, but this code was written holding on the logic of the sorting program.
